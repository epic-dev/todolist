# ToDo app (Bun + Elysia stack on backend, React on frontend)
    The main idea is to show the tech stack I use for day-to-day work or learn something new.

    ## Backend stack
        ### Bun
        ### Elysia
        ### MongoDB
    ## Frontend stack
        ### React
        ### styled components
        (Remix possibly in future).

#### Things to be done
1. GraphQL resolvers for ToDo's
2. mongo db indexes
